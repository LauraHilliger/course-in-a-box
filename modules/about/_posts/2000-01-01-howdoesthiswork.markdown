#Our Learning Offering

Teach Like Mozilla has several overarching themes for you to explore. Those topics are located at the top of the page, and include several modules to help you take your learning deeper. Each module starts with a brief overview of the concepts you should think about, and ends with a suggested activity for you to make something or explore a particular idea further. Start with the topic that interests you most and feel free to skip around!

Don't forget, you're not alone. There's a community of lifelong learners in our [discussion forum](http://discourse.webmaker.org).

#The Topics

## Exploring Pedagogies

Learn about the theoretical frameworks and pedagogies (teaching methods) the Mozilla community uses. This module also helps you understand the web as an ecosystem and why an open web is so important. 

## Participatory Learning
