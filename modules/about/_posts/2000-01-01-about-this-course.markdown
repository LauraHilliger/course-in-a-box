Welcome to [#TeachTheWeb](https://twitter.com/search?q=teachtheweb&src=typd&f=realtime). We’re glad you’re here. If you’re new to the Mozilla community, here is sample of what’s in store:

## What will I do here?

We’re here to help you integrate digital making and web skills into your teaching practice with collaborative, peer-to-peer methodologies. You’ll be learning the community-driven pedagogies behind Webmaker by building things yourself, sharing them with others, and starting to teach the world the web.

## This course will help you:

* Integrate the mechanics, culture and citizenship of the web into your practice.
* Bring creativity to your teaching through open, participatory methods.
* Connect with fellow mentors and educators (especially those in your local area) to share knowledge and resources.
* Connect with the global community of Mozillians who are working to spread [web literacy](http://webmaker.org/literacy)

## Where did the content come from?

Much of the content of this course was built with loving attention by Mozillians and other open practitioners. We've remixed open content from across the web, but would like to give special thanks to:

* [Matt Thompson](http://openmatt.org)--a champion of open, and someone who takes the time and effort to document a great many open resources so that we can create content like what you'll find in this course.

* [Facilitators of Open](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/summit-sessions-saturday-practicingopen) In 2013 a number of people ran workshops at the Mozilla Summit on the practice of working open. They brainstormed, documented, collected, and published a great many resources.

* [Peer 2 Peer University](http://p2pu.org)--they build learning communities on the web. They are also a 100% open organization that practices what it preaches, and serve as a stellar example for openness.

* [School of Open](http://schoolofopen.org) The School of Open helps the general public learn about open licensing and open practices. There's amazing and wonderful content explaining the why of open, and we'll not be rewriting it. Instead, we'll pull together specific resources for working openly within Mozilla, and point to our friends and kindred spirits on all the other stuff ;)
