## What will I do here?

We’re here to help you integrate digital making and web skills into your teaching practice with collaborative, peer-to-peer methodologies. You’ll be learning the community-driven pedagogies behind Webmaker by building things yourself, sharing them with others, and starting to teach the world the web.

## This course will help you:

* Integrate the mechanics, culture and citizenship of the web into your practice.
* Bring creativity to your teaching through open, participatory methods.
* Connect with fellow mentors and educators (especially those in your local area) to share knowledge and resources.
* Connect with the global community of Mozillians who are working to spread [web literacy](http://webmaker.org/literacy)
