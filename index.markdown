## Community Education

The Mozilla Reps program aims to empower and support volunteer Mozillians who want to become official representatives of Mozilla in their region/locale.

With this in mind we are designing educational and training modules to help Reps become more successful in the project.  Check back soon for a regular calendar of opportunities , and ways to get involved with Community Education.
