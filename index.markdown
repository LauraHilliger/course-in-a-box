## Learning, Teaching and Growing Community

The Mozilla Reps program aims to empower and support volunteer Mozillians who want to become official representatives of Mozilla in their region/locale.

Education and Training are a key piece in empowering our community as individuals, contributors and community builders.  

Check back soon for training opportunities, and ways to get involved with Community Education :)
