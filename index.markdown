## Learning, Teaching and Growing Community

The Mozilla Reps program aims to empower and support volunteer Mozillians who want to become official representatives of Mozilla in their region/locale, or functional area.

Education and Training are a key piece in empowering our community as individuals, contributors and community builders.  While many modules will be focused on Reps, and Rep activities, participation is open to all.
