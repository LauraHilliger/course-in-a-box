## Shift Dynamics and Put the Learners in Charge

We want a web that is open, accessible and ours. In order to achieve that, more of us need to understand its basic mechanics, its culture and what it means to be a citizen of the web. **Teach Like Mozilla** is part of Mozilla's commitment to help educators and others teach vital web literacy skills. Everything here is 100% free, open source and powered by a global community of people like you who want to teach digital and web skills in ways that are creative, participatory and fun.

Mozillians worldwide have started using participatory methods and open practices to #TeachTheWeb in coffee shops, Web Clubs, maker-focused events and classrooms. **Teach Like Mozilla** is designed to help you learn the ins and outs of modern pedagogies and practices that instill learner-centric approaches in educator defined learning objectives. 

Join anytime. Learn at your own pace. Connect with our [global community](http://discourse.webmaker.org) helping one another teach web literacy, digital skills and open practices. Learn how to #TeachTheWeb.

Once you feel like the lessons here are part of your everyday practice, you might be interested in further development through the [Community Education modules](http://education.mozilla-community.org/) which aim to further empower Mozillians in their contributions to the web.
