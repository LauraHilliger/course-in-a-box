![webapp](http://tiptoes.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-02-28_1308.png)

Most critical for the short-term success of Firefox OS Market Research, and our Market Research Impact Team is the collection of local pricing for FFOS. The [Market Pulse Web App](https://marketpulse.mozilla.community/] web app will make it easy to collect FFOS data for:

* Web Stores
* Local Stores

## Web App

We'll be using the [Market Pulse Web App](https://marketpulse.mozilla.community) to record data. It will also help you track activities and contributions over time.  For this first activity we'll be collecting the following information:

#### Store Name
Full store name, no abbreviations.

#### Online Store (yes/no)
Indicates whether or not this price is being recorded from an online store.  

#### Store Location
Using Open Street Map & your device location will record the store's location.

#### Device Type
Phone device brand, selected from an a list.

#### Whether or not the phone is in stock

This is a verbal confirmation from store owners, can is recorded as true or false in the web app.  See 'Pricing Scenarios' below for more on this data.

#### Price 
The price of the device.

#### Currency
Price currency for the reported price.

#### Comments
A very important part of data collection are all those observations that occur to you as you record information. We will get into more detail about best practices next.

## Pricing Scenarios

The Market Pulse Web App will allow you to collect multiple prices for different price scenarios, and for multiple device-types.  

### In Stock

It may seem obvious what's in stock for a store, but display may only represent a portion of what's in stock. 
For the best information, ask the store clerk about their FFOS phones in their store. A good question to ask might be:

> "What FireFox OS devices to you have in stock ?"

### Out of Stock

Another important question, even if the store currently carrying one or more FFOS phones is:

> "Are there any FireFox OS devices you normally carry, that are not currently in stock?"

And finally  - if there are devices not in stock:

> "Will you be getting new stock?"

#### Not Returning

If you find a phone 'out of stock', and the store clerk has indicated they will not be getting new stock in - then please indicate this in the comments and with a phone price of 0

### Regular Price

The 'regular price' of a phone, is simply the cost of a phone for purchase. This is different, of course, from phones on sale, or sold as part of a package.  When you record this price, you will indicate that this phone is NOT part of a plan.

### As Part of a Package

![package](http://tiptoes.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-01_1751.png)

Stores usually sell phones individually (regular price), or part of a package with things like data, or other incentives like Lego and data plans.  When you record this price in the WEb App, you will indicate that this phone IS part of a plan.   Also, adding in comments exactly what comes with the package is very important and useful information to Market Research.

### On Sale

Regular priced phones, that are not part of a package with a reduced price are 'on Sale'.  There is no specific data-entry for sale prices, so it's super important to indicate in the 'comments' section if this phone price is indicated as 'On Sale'.  

Sales may also be store-wide or on specific devices.  Also in the comments, please add the scope of the sale price.


## Collection Scenarios

### Once Per Month

Collection of phone prices needs to be done once per month.  Reporting the same phone price in the same month is discouraged.  

### Exception

If a price changes, or new offer appears within the month, you are encouraged to report this change as a new price. Again, the comments section helps explain to Market Pulse what prompted your entry.

## Comments

Adding meaningful comments for prices-collected will go a long way to help the Market Pulse team understand the pricing of phones in your region.   Some suggestions for topics are:

* Positioning of FFOS phones in the store
* Whether or not a phone price is 'sale'
* Outside or internal advertising for FFOS
* Comments from store clerks about people who have purchased FFOS
* Feedback from store clerks about why people do, or do not select FFOS

### Spreadsheet 
TODO: is this still an option?
