If a Mozilla Rep wants to request funds to support initiatives in their community or as part of an impact team, they may submit and request funding through the program.  Budgets empower our community to reach success otherwise not possible without funding, but is not meant to be the sole resource for success - other initaitives like partnership (with other communities), and donation are encouraged as other attributes of success.

Below are the steps we'll cover as part of Reps training.  Each step represents an opportunity for you to ask questions, share experiences and improve this curriculum for those that follow you.  Thanks for your feedback!

There are two steps to budget review.

When your event is over, adding photos, blog posts to the budget are requirements - as are updating your after-event metrics in the Reps Portal.  It's OK if your event didn't work out as planned, but sharing the story of what worked, what didn't work as well as explanations for overages will help you and others in future. 

Of course receipts are a key requirement for all reimbursements and we'll get into a bit more detail about those as well.
