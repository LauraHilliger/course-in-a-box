#Budget Preparation

The best budgets reflect thoughtful consideration of metrics, participation and leadership.  

## Metrics

In 2015 Mozilla Reps, and Impact teams will be encouraged to focused more directly on project goals.  And metrics that demonstrate impact on a project or product goal will be most compelling for budget support. Here are some examples.  There are two types of metrics you should consider when planning an event:

> ### Impact Metrics

> 1.  FFOS Market Pulse goals are collection of FFOS phone prices in local markets.
> 2.  Webmaker has quarterly goals related to 'Webmaker Club' initiatives
> 3.  Marketplace requires more mobile-friendly websites.

So budgets in support of, perhaps, helping purchase memory sticks for a Webmaker Club,  an event where participants scan the web for mobile-friendly news- sites would also be more compelling for support.  

### Event or Initiative Metrics

So, these are the more specific metric you'll see in the portal.  How many participants do you expect. Identifying outcomes for participants, for 'work being done' will better demonstrate your success afterwards.  Metrics support budgets, but they also lend to our overall learning and growth as a community - it's OK to be optimistic :)

## Agenda or Schedule

Detailed, and well-thought-out agendas that support your metrics are *gold* for mentor and council review.  Agendas can provide insight into not only how you intend to be sucessful, but also provide a window for mentors and council to help you get there. Of course not all initiatives are events, so consider this step to simply about schedule.   Mentors especially, have the experience to give you feedback at this stage that will help you create a successful budget.

**Curriculum Future Improvement: In future we'll list some examples of good agendas**

## Resources

Resources are your agenda come to life!  The people, the places, the materials...  A suggestion is to make a list of assets you need, and then to start documenting the resources you have to obtain them.  Some steps could be to first list the resources you need:

* People 
* Space  (or not)
* Technology
* Food
* Printing/Paper

Write an optimistic 'best case scenerio', what you can obtain with and without budget.

* 4 volunteers  (3 local, 1 travel)  (need budget for 1 airfare, 1 hotel room)
* Community Hall (Donated)
* Wireless (Donated)
* Lunch(sandwiches at pop) for 50 people (need budget)
* 15 posters, 50 paper invitations  (need budget)

Finally, write another list of resources, with considerations for those things you could to improve budget

* 4 volunteers  (3 local, 1 travel)  (need budget for 1 airfare, but Mozillian can stay at our house)
* Community Hall (Donated)
* Wireless (Donated)
* Lunch(sandwiches at pop) for 50 people (need budget)  , People will arrive early and leave late so minimum we need to provide is lunch .  We get 10% off all orders over 30 at our local shop, so the price is good.
* 5 posters, 20 paper invitations  (need budget)

 If you absolutely cannot reduce budget, add a reason and any other reasons to support the pricing you'll suggest. Especially when it comes to travel. If you can't run an event with the 3 local Mozillians, explain why the fourth matters to your metrics.

 ** Although it may seem more complicated - this approach can work for large budgets, with multiple reimbursements as well.  Stay tuned for more on that.


** Now you have metrics, an agenda and a best-case scenerio to submit to your mentor.  You also have some awareness of where your budget could be reduced if you absolutely had to, and reasons supporting your request.**

# You are Awesome By the Way!

This is a lot of work, and before you step into mentor and council review - know this:  your work preparing a budget is appreciated, valued and important.  Also know that the next phase of review does not in anyway detract from that, suggestions from mentor and council to improve - well intended and not personal.


## Discussion

1. What ways do you prepare to submit a budget?
2. What ways can Reps seek alternate donation, or funding before consideration of budget?
3. What recognition do you think Reps should recieve for low, or no-budget requests?
4. What ways have you saved on budgets in the past?
5. What things have you never been sure about, when requesting budget?
