By the time you reach this stage, you are already a super hero.   The next part can be the most challanging, as you actually fill out the budget form, and go through the process of review. Keep in mind though, that your mentor is there to both support you, and help council - theirs is a very difficult role.

The Budget Form can be [found here](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/form.reps.budget).  Some Key SOPs, documentation and a blog post to read:

It's understandable that as passionate and successful volunteers, we can feel sensitive when our budgets are questioned, please keep in mind budgets are not personal.
