Just as mentorship is core to the success of the Reps program, Communication is vital to the success of mentors.  And the scope and importance of commmunication is vast enough that we want to specifically include it in training.

##With the Reps Community
[Discourse](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/) exists to empower community conversation. Use it to share sucesses, ask questions, give shout-outs to mentees, to propose ideas or invite collaboration.  As mentor, your help keeping this community active and thriving is appreciated and valued.

##With Your Mentee

Based on the [Orientation call](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mentor_Orientation_Call), be deliberate about scheduling communication with your mentee. Time can go by very quickly without realizing it's been one month, or two - or three. Adding it to the calender as a reminder ensures consistency which really makes a difference for your mentee. And for you! Now is a good time to think about how communication with our own mentor is working, and whether that needs revisited as well.

Ensure your communication times have specific goals, even if it's just to ask for feedback, on how a recent event went, how they feel about something recent in the program (like change to reports). Always keep in mind opportunity to improve the project by elevating feedback to other parts of the project.

If feedback indicates an issue that council should be aware of, please email council with details. Examples could be:

* Discussions where your mentee reports having faced abusive behavior in the community.
* Discussions where your mentee expresses concerns about misused funds or swag in their community.
* Discussions where your mentee shares successes, ideas and/or initiatives that could benefit the Reps program as a whole.
* General concerns you may have about your mentee, that may be too personal to discuss with the mentor community.

 *If feedback is important to a functional area, or leadership in general encourage your mentee to reach out to those groups or offer to do it if they are not comfortable.*


##With Other Mentors


It's important to understand that as a new mentor, you have a community of mentors to lean on, and to ask for advice. There is a LOT to mentoring, and so don't be shy about posting questions on the dist list, or requesting feedback. Or if you find yourself to have great success in one area, sharing that will help others too. 

##With Council

You are your mentees first line of communication, BUT please know that council is exists to support you on matters that may feel out of your comfort-zone or expertise to deal with. Please reach out any time for assistance.

Although not specifically communication-related, one of the most important things you can share is the news (and names!) of new and emerging leaders. Mozilla leaderhip is often asked seeking community opinions, and while we are good at celebrating existing, and longer-term leadership it's a goal to be more deliberate about including emerging leaders in discussions: Diversity of new visions, new ideas, new energy helps us grow in health. **Please help identify emerging leaders!**

#Discussion

1. What do you think matters most, when selecting communication tools with your mentee?
2. [Think about a positive experience asking for help, advice or feedback in the Mozilla community.  What about that experience can lend to your new role as a mentor?](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/mentor-training-communication/1725/2?u=emma_irwin)
3. [Try to recall a time where you wanted to reach out to your mentor, council or someone else on the project.  What do you think made that so difficult?  How can you help your mentee overcome similar challanges?](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/mentor-training-communication/1725/3?u=emma_irwin)
4. [Understanding that everyone is different, and how you and your mentee communicate will be unique to your partnership - how can you ensure the conversation is not one-way(not just you talking)?](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/mentor-training-communication/1725/4?u=emma_irwin)
